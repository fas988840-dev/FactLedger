# FactLedger — Grant Submission Record

> ⚠️ **This file is out of date and superseded.** It was written before the
> API was deployed, before Colosseum/ChainGPT status changed, and it flags
> the live-demo artifact link and repo-rename redirect as unverified —
> both are resolved in current docs. For the current, accurate state, read
> [`GRANTS/funding-roadmap.md`](GRANTS/funding-roadmap.md).

**Last updated**: August 31, 2026

This file records what was actually submitted, with the evidence for each
claim. Entries without evidence are marked as such rather than asserted.
This mirrors the project's own rule (see `CLAUDE.md`): a claim that cannot
be independently verified is not written down as fact.

## Submissions

### 1. Startup Accelerator Grant — Webacy / DD.xyz (via Superteam Earn)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Listing | "Startup Accelerator Grant", sponsored by Webacy, grant by DD.xyz |
| Platform | earn.superteam.fun (listing) → `hy35k9ea.typeform.com` (form) |
| Stated award | Up to $10,000 USD |
| Status | **Submitted** |
| Evidence | Typeform completion screen: "Thank you for applying! We will get back to you shortly." with Webacy branding and promo code `AINSIDER1872` (3 months Webacy Pro) |

**Note on a possible duplicate**: a second identical confirmation text was
observed. Because the text is byte-identical to the first, it cannot be
distinguished from a re-display of the same submission. Whether one or two
submissions of this same form exist is **unknown**. No second, different
grant program was confirmed.

### 2. Solana Foundation — $25,000

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | **Submitted — CONFIRMED** |
| Evidence | Confirmation email from "Solana Grants", subject "Solana Grant Submission Confirmation", received 10:30 AM. Signed Solana Foundation, Damstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland. |
| Amount | $25,000, per `GRANTS/solana-foundation-proposal-doc.md`. The email does not restate an amount. |
| Response window | The email states review and response **within one month of the submission date**, varying with application volume. They contact applicants directly if a team member wants to know more. |

### 3. Colosseum Eternal — NOT SUBMITTED

No Colosseum application was observed being filled out or confirmed.
Earlier drafts of this file claimed a confirmed $15,000 Colosseum grant.
**That claim was incorrect and has been removed.**

If you want to apply: https://colosseum.org — answers are prepared in
`COPY_PASTE_ANSWERS.txt` and `GRANTS/send-grants.html`.

### 4. ChainGPT Research — NOT SUBMITTED

`www.chaingpt.org/web3-ai-grant` returned 404 when checked. No application filed.

## Honest totals

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Confirmed submitted (Webacy/DD.xyz, award **up to** $10,000) | up to $10,000 |
| Reported submitted, unverified here (Solana Foundation) | $25,000 |
| **Awarded to date** | **$0 — no grant has been approved** |

"Up to $10,000" is the listing's stated ceiling, not an amount requested,
promised, or received.

---

## Bonus actually received

- Promo code `AINSIDER1872` — 3 months Webacy Pro, redeemable at Stripe
  checkout. This is the only thing of value confirmed received so far.

## Project state

Claims below are attributed to their source. Nothing here was verified in
the session that wrote this file — `npm install` fails in that environment
(npm registry returns 403), so tests, lint, type-check, and the Docker
build could not be run locally.

| Claim | Source | Verified here? |
|---|---|---|
| 133 tests pass | GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | No — check the CI badge / Actions tab |
| TypeScript strict, no lint errors | Same CI run | No |
| Docker image builds | `Dockerfile` present; build not run here | No |
| 12 REST endpoints implemented | Readable in `src/api/server.ts` | Code present, not exercised |
| Read-only architecture | Enforced in code, documented in `CLAUDE.md` | Design invariant |

**To verify any of the above yourself**, open the Actions tab on the
repository and read the latest run, or clone and run `npm ci && npm test`
somewhere with npm registry access.

## Repository

- Canonical owner/name: `fas988840-dev/factledger`.
- Historical repository names are not canonical and should not be used in new
  applications or product links.
- Repository was archived on Aug 31, 2026 and has since been **unarchived**;
  it accepts writes again.

## Open issue: the "live demo" link

About 20 places across `GRANTS/`, `GRANTS/grant-answers.html`, and
`COPY_PASTE_ANSWERS.txt` present this URL as a **"Live demo (public docs
page, live now)"**:

```
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d4bd6b65-b871-4e54-a0e6-ae418bc3e4be
```

Artifacts on claude.ai are **private by default**. If this one was never
shared publicly, every reviewer who clicked it hit an auth wall — including
on proposals already submitted.

**This was not verified** (claude.ai is unreachable from the environment
that wrote this note). **Test it yourself in a private/incognito window.**
If it asks for login, stop describing it as a live public demo, and replace
it with one of:

- GitHub Pages on `docs/` (see README's "Public Docs Page") — needs
  Settings → Pages → branch `main`, folder `/docs`
- A real deployed API URL (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- The repository URL alone, which is the only link confirmed public

---

## What to do next

1. ~~Unarchive the repository~~ — done.
2. **Test the "live demo" link** in a private/incognito window (see the
   section above). This is the one open item that could still be misleading
   reviewers of already-submitted proposals.
3. **Check `fas988840@gmail.com`** for the Solana Foundation confirmation
   and update the table above with what you actually find.
4. **Decide on Colosseum** — it was never submitted. Apply or drop it.
5. Wait for a response on the Webacy/DD.xyz application.
