/**
 * Live Alert Watcher - the standing, WebSocket-driven counterpart to
 * AlertEngine's one-shot, per-request evaluation (src/services/alert-engine.ts).
 * This is the "upgrade the Alert system to live/streaming" gap named
 * explicitly in this project's own funding-application drafts - now real.
 *
 * How it works: subscribes to new log notifications for a wallet via
 * SolanaRpcClient.subscribeToLogs() (a read-only WebSocket subscription -
 * never a signed transaction). Each notification re-evaluates the
 * wallet's most recent transactions through the same deterministic
 * pipeline (BehaviorAnalyzer -> RiskAssessor -> AlertEngine) the REST
 * /alerts endpoint already uses, and reports only alerts that are new
 * since this watcher started (never re-announces one already seen) - so a
 * caller streaming this gets exactly the same evidence-cited Alert
 * objects as the one-shot endpoint, just delivered as they happen instead
 * of only on request.
 *
 * ⚠️ VERIFICATION STATUS: Solana RPC access was blocked by this sandbox's
 * network egress policy when this was written, so this has NOT been
 * exercised against a live subscription - see the verification note on
 * SolanaRpcClient.subscribeToLogs() for what's confirmed vs. assumed
 * about that API. Separately, and independent of this sandbox: many
 * public/free RPC endpoints (including the default
 * api.mainnet-beta.solana.com) restrict or disable WebSocket log
 * subscriptions - a dedicated RPC provider is typically required for this
 * to hold a subscription reliably in production. Test against a real
 * endpoint before relying on it.
